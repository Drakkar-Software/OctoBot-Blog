# Why sharing an OctoBot profile ?

In OctoBot, your configuration is stored as a profile. A profile contains:
- Your activated trading mode and evaluators alongside their configuration
- Your traded pairs
- The exchanges you are currently using (without authentication credentials)

Sharing your profile means sharing your current trading strategy configuration. Anyone using your profile will be able to trade in the exact same way as you do with your OctoBot.

# How to share a profile ?

1. Select and download it from your OctoBot

# Next steps

Sharing profiles is the first step towards [OctoBot Cloud](https://www.octobot.cloud/) as a platform where OctoBot users can share whole trading strategies. Profiles are merely strategy configurations and we will soon add the possibility to share whole strategies.

With OctoBot Cloud, you will be able to:
- Use and share any strategy with our without sharing its code and configuration
- Checkout past performances of available strategies
- Create and use paid or free strategies that are made by the community: creators are incentivized to create strategies with the best results to earn money from paid subscribers that use the strategies 


# Join the beta

Sharing profiles will first be available on the [beta OctoBot Cloud](https://beta.octobot.cloud/).
