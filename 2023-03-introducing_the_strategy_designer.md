# Visualize exactly what happened
When creating a trading strategy, the hardest part is often to test the strategy in order to find the best configuration for the target market.

With the Strategy Designer, you will find many tools to experiment, analyse, compare and optimize your strategies and their configurations to their full potential.

Using the Strategy Designer, for any trading strategy, you can visualize each backtesting run:
- Trades
- Positions (when trading futures)
- PNL
- Portfolio value
- Configuration
- Other insightful metrics

# Compare backtesting runs
Being able to see the exact behavior of your strategy through time in each backtest is good, comparing those values across backtesting results is better.

Each analysis tool can be used to compare run results.

# Store results  

When running the Strategy Designer backtesting, results are always stored. This way you can always come back to a previous setup and easily compare it with others.
