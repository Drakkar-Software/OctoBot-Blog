# A clear display of your backtesting runs
Based on your feedback, we have been working a lot making the Strategy Designer much easier to use and understand. The strategy designer is now split into 2 parts:
1. The Strategy Viewer: where you can quickly analyze and compare trading strategies based on their performances
2. The Strategy Creator: where you can easily create a new strategy in order to test it in backtesting 

The Strategy Designer is now our most advanced interface to create, test and compare strategies, we hope you will enjoy it.

# The Strategy Viewer
Quickly view, analyze and compare how your strategies behave and are more or less profitable or risky through time.

# The Strategy Creator

1. Select the markets to trade on as well as the starting portfolio of your OctoBot for this strategy.

4. Configure the final touch: the type of exchange and backtesting time window. You can also give a name to your backtesting run to quickly identify it later on.

5. Start your backtesting: if necessary, OctoBot will fetch the required historical data from your exchange and will then launch a backtesting using your strategy. Results of the backtesting run will be stored in your history and available for later views and comparisons.

# From backtesting to live trading 

Strategies created within the Strategy Designer remain in the Strategy Designer until converted into a live profile. They are independent and not affecting your live OctoBot. This means that you can test a Daily Trading  strategy on the Strategy Designer that should be trading MATIC while having a live Dip Analyzer strategy that is trading BTC and ETH.

Once you are satisfied with your trading strategy created in the Strategy Designer, you can instantly convert it into a live OctoBot profile

![convert to live profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot-Blog/master/resources/images/strategy-designer-revamp/use_as_live.png)

This profile will then be usable as any profile, which means that you can also share and edit it just the way you want.

# How to get the Strategy Designer ?

The Strategy Designer is available to OctoBots running on [OctoBot Cloud](https://www.octobot.cloud/) using the Pro Plan.
