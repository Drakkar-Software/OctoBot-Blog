## What's cryptocurrency trading

Cryptocurrency trading is the process of buying and selling cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography to secure their transactions and to control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they are not subject to government or financial institution control. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009. 

Cryptocurrency trading is a relatively new practice, but it has grown in popularity as more people become interested in cryptocurrencies. In 2018, Bitcoin's value increased by over 1000%, leading to a surge in interest in other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency trading can be done through online exchanges, and many people trade cryptocurrencies as a way to make money. 

If you're interested in trading cryptocurrencies, there are a few things you should know. First, you need to understand how the market works and what factors can affect cryptocurrency prices. You also need to choose an exchange and wallet that you trust, and have a good understanding of the risks involved. Finally, don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and always remember that cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly.

## Why using a trading bot? 

There are many reasons why you might want to use a trading bot. Perhaps you want to free up your time so that you can focus on other things, or maybe you want to take advantage of the 24-hour trading cycle by having a bot that can trade for you around the clock. Whatever your reason, a trading bot can be a helpful tool in your trading arsenal.

One of the main advantages of using a trading bot is that it can help to take emotion out of the equation. When you are manually trading, it can be easy to let emotions like greed or fear influence your decisions. This can lead to bad trades that lose you money. A trading bot, on the other hand, is not influenced by emotions and will only execute trades based on pre-determined rules that you have set. This can help you to stick to your trading plan and make better, more informed decisions.

Another benefit of using a trading bot is that it can help you to diversify your portfolio. If you are only manually trading one or two assets, you are missing out on the opportunity to profit from the moves in other markets. By using a bot, you can trade multiple assets simultaneously and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

## What's open source?

In the world of software development, open source is a term used to describe a project or program that is available for anyone to use or modify. Open source projects are usually developed by a community of developers who work together to create and improve the code. OctoBot is an open source project that anyone can contribute to. We welcome new contributors!
