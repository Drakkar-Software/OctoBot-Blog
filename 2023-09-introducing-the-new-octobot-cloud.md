# Why a new OctoBot cloud ?

At OctoBot, we realized that the current state of OctoBot is suitable for users with a technical background but is too complex for the majority of people.

The goal of OctoBot has always been to bring automated trading strategies to any crypto investor. This includes tech savvy users as well as all the others. Up until now, OctoBot failed to be usable by any crypto investor and [the new OctoBot cloud](https://octobot.click/xl3ZPZ) is built for them.

**While the full OctoBot is designed to create and customize strategies, the new OctoBot cloud makes it very easy to use those strategies**

We are splitting OctoBot plans into 2 different kinds: 
1. Strategy based plans
2. Full OctoBot plans

# Choose a strategy, not a robot: strategy based plans
OctoBot can be complicated to use and setup, finding your suitable strategy can be even more difficult. That's why we make strategy based plans as simple and clear as possible

## OctoBot, but simple
Ideally, when you want to use a strategy and not create one, you want to:
1. Explore and compare available strategies
2. Understand potential profits and risks of the strategy of your choice
3. Apply this strategy on your exchange account

It shouldn't be more complicated than this. Making these steps as easy as possible is our goal with the Investor and Trader plans.

Therefore, using those plans, you don't need to care about your OctoBot, we are doing it for you. You just need to:

1. Select the strategy of your choice

2. follow your gains directly from [OctoBot cloud](https://octobot.click/xl3ZPZ)

Besides simplicity, making strategies financially accessible is also important to us. For this reason, we designed the Investor plan to be completely free and unlimited.

## No cost, monthly fees, it just works
At OctoBot, we believe that making an free plan will help a lot of people accessing automated trading strategies. 

That's why the Investor plan enables everyone to simply use trading strategies for free. 

This not a free trial: when you use a strategy with the Investor plan, we are not asking for your payment information, there is **no monthly subscription fee, no % taken on gains, no hidden fees**.

> How is this possible ? When using the Investor plan, we rely on exchange partnerships to pay for our running costs. This means that as long as you use an exchange account from an OctoBot official partner exchange, exchanges reward us and you are free to use the Investor plan forever.

The Trader plan on the other hand, besides other benefits, allows you to trade on exchanges we don't have a partnership with. This plan therefore requires a paid monthly subscription.

## Transparency is key

Of couse, each strategy on [OctoBot cloud](https://octobot.click/xl3ZPZ) is built, run and tested using OctoBot. This means that each strategy past performance is evaluated on a regular basis using historical data and OctoBot's backtesting engine. This ensures that displayed statistics are real as strategy based plans are also using OctoBot under the hood.

At OctoBot we believe in transparency. This means that sometimes strategies can turn unprofitable as profits depends on so many different factors including market conditions. **If a strategy is not making profits during a given period, you will see it before using it.**


## In a nutshell
> The new Investor and Trader plans allow you to enjoy trading strategies in a very easy yet powerful way. Benefit from OctoBot based strategies without the technicalities of OctoBot.
